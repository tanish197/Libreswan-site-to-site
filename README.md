Here’s a professionally rewritten version of your README file for installing Terraform and adding the PEM private key file to an EC2 instance:

# **Installing Terraform and Adding PEM Private Key to EC2 Instance**

This guide provides detailed instructions for installing Terraform on a Linux-based EC2 instance (Amazon Linux 2, Ubuntu, or Debian) and adding your PEM private key to the instance for secure SSH access.

---

## **1. Install Terraform**

### **For Amazon Linux 2 or RHEL-based Distributions (CentOS, Fedora)**

1. **Update the System:**

   ```bash
   sudo yum update -y
   ```

2. **Install Required Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   sudo yum install -y yum-utils
   ```

3. **Add the HashiCorp Linux Repository:**

   ```bash
   sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/AmazonLinux/hashicorp.repo
   ```

4. **Install Terraform:**

   ```bash
   sudo yum install terraform -y
   ```

5. **Verify the Installation:**

   ```bash
   terraform --version
   ```

---

### **For Ubuntu or Debian-based Distributions (Ubuntu Server)**

1. **Update the System:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update -y
   ```

2. **Install Required Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y gnupg software-properties-common curl
   ```

3. **Add the HashiCorp GPG Key:**

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
   ```

4. **Add the HashiCorp Linux Repository:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt-add-repository "deb https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main"
   ```

5. **Update the Package Index:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update -y
   ```

6. **Install Terraform:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install terraform -y
   ```

7. **Verify the Installation:**

   ```bash
   terraform --version
   ```

---

### **Manual Installation (Alternative Method)**

1. **Download the Latest Terraform Release:**

   Visit the official Terraform download page: [Terraform Downloads](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

   Then, use `wget` to download the latest version for your system. For example:

   ```bash
   wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.5.0/terraform_1.5.0_linux_amd64.zip
   ```

2. **Unzip the Downloaded File:**

   ```bash
   unzip terraform_1.5.0_linux_amd64.zip
   ```

3. **Move the Terraform Binary to `/usr/local/bin/`:**

   ```bash
   sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/
   ```

4. **Verify the Installation:**

   ```bash
   terraform --version
   ```

## **2. Add PEM Private Key for SSH Access**

1. **Copy the PEM Private Key to the EC2 Instance:**

The term "private shared key" is a bit ambiguous, but it seems you are referring to a private key that is used in a public-key cryptography system, which might be shared for authentication purposes.

When discussing a private key in a security context (especially in a VPN or SSH setup), it usually refers to a cryptographic key that is part of a key pair (public and private keys). Here's a breakdown of what that means when the key is used in an on-prem (on-premises) context:

Private Key (in cryptography):
Private Key: This is a secret key that is used in asymmetric encryption algorithms. It is kept private and should never be shared or exposed.

Public Key: This is paired with the private key and can be shared publicly. The public key is used to encrypt messages or verify signatures created with the corresponding private key.

Shared Key (in symmetric encryption):
In symmetric encryption, a shared key refers to a single secret key that both parties use for encryption and decryption. This key must be kept secret and is shared between trusted parties (like a server and client), usually in a secure way (e.g., during initial key exchange).

Private Shared Key in an On-Premises Setup:
When you mention "private shared key" in the context of an on-premises setup, it could mean:

Private Key for SSH or VPN (like IPsec): This private key is part of a key pair used for secure connections (such as SSH or a VPN tunnel). You would keep the private key secure on your local server and only share the public key with other trusted parties (e.g., a remote server or VPN endpoint).

Shared Secret for Symmetric Encryption: In some contexts, you might also be referring to a shared secret key (in symmetric encryption) used to encrypt and decrypt communications between two systems. This shared key would be stored securely and should not be publicly exposed.

Private Key on-premises:
In an on-premises (on-prem) context, the private key is typically stored on a local server or machine (like a company’s internal server). You may use this key for various purposes such as:

SSH Authentication: Secure access to servers without using passwords.

VPN Authentication: Securely authenticate connections between your on-prem servers and external networks.

TLS/SSL Certificates: For securing HTTP connections between clients and servers.

In these cases, the private key remains on the local server (on-prem), and it's essential that it is protected and not exposed, as it allows access to secure resources.
